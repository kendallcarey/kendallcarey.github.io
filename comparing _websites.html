		<h5>Huffington Post</h5>
		<p>I like read the news articles, even though the articles can be a bit biased. The first thing I notice is the headline for the news story, tonight its about the black box. If you step back, the red image is what you notice first. They both work effectively to draw the reader into reading their main article. It is clearly built like a newspaper. At first glance, its simple, basic, clean, appealing, and maybe boring. It keeps the reader up to date on the latest news stories. The content ranges from useful and interesting to bizarre, silly and just plain pointless. Its about as easy to sort through as a newspaper. I get annoyed at myself if I spend too much time on the website as I do eventually stumble upon the pointless articles which make me angry. The site itself does not sell anything but there are advertisements for things to purchase.</p>
		<h5>Zozi</h5>
		<p>I love to check the latest activities in the area that Zozi offers discounts for. The first thing I notice is the main picture (which changes every 7 seconds) with the latest or most popular deals. If you step back, the picture is still the main thing you see. As the pictures tend to be colorful (and move) it makes the website appealing. It is created like a web store with every discounted deal in its own small block below the main picture. The page is colorful, not-cluttered, simple, smooth, and fun. It gives discounted rates for adventurous activities and equipment in your area. The content is fun, crazy, exciting, cool, and interesting. Its really simple to navigate. I can spend a long time researching different activities which is fun but I have never actually purchased anything. I just like to dream about it.</p>
		<h5>Youtube</h5>
		<p>Youtube: for any video you could possibly ever want to see to all the videos you donâ€™t know why you are watching. The first thing you notice on the start page is the huge advertisement for Spiderman 2 right in the middle. No matter where you stand, its pretty much all you see. Its kind of annoying unless what you went to youtube for was to see the trailer for Spiderman 2. Its created kind of like Zozi where each video and a blurb about it is in its own little block beneath the giant advertisement. The website is boring, distracting, white, cluttered, and over-stimulating. The website provides videos that any user can submit or watch and share with others. The content is all over the place, ranging from pointless to cool and weird to cute or just informative. Its easy to navigate with simple key words or tags in the search box. I can waste hours on this site starting at one interesting video that I had been searching for to some other crazy off tangent video that I had not been searching for and can't figure out how I got sucked into it. This website (thought it has a lot of advertisements, even in its content) does not sell anything on the site.</p>
