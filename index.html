				<p>You- “Absolute positioning? What the - … I’m so confused!”</p>
				<p>Never fear! I am here to help with my easy to read three-pronged thesis style blog. Enjoy ☺</p>
				<p>Last week I was still unsure of the meaning of some of the CSS positioning, specifically position: relative, position: absolute, and position; fixed. I decided to do more research to understand it.</p>
				<p>When you have an image, text or other element on your page, positioning is important to give your webpage have the look you’ve imagined or just for organization. Positioning can be placed between style tags in your html document or a separate document used for CSS styles.</p>
				<p>When you want to move an element relative to where it would normally occur on the document you could use position: relative in your CSS document. If you use position: relative and no other positioning attributes, it will do nothing. But if you do give it another attribute, for instance (top:10px), it will move the element 10px down from where it was. This means you can specify the distance from the top, bottom and sides. From my research, I’ve found that it may not appear as useful as it can be.</p>
				<p>When you use the absolute positioning, this means it is removed and separate from the document, meaning you can place it exactly where you want it by using the other positioning attributes (like top, bottom and/or sides, specifying how far away from each of course). It’s not affected by the other elements on the page. Over-usage can limit flexibility on your website though.</p>
				<p>Fixed positioning is not used as often as the other two in this blog but has its uses. Fixed positioning means that the element will remain fixed in the specific spot relative to the browser window. This means that if you scroll down the page, the element will not scroll and remain on the browser window exactly the same distance from the sides. It could be useful for navigation purposes. Say you use fixed positioning on a sidebar, no matter where the user is on the webpage they can navigate to other pages of the website.</p>
				<p>Each has their uses for making your website beautiful and look exactly how you want it to.</p>
