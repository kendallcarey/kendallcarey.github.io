				<h2>Functional vs. OOP</h2>
				<p id="center">With a little experience in both, I decided to do some extra research to give this blog some extra umph! I decided to check out some biased blogs and books for comparison.</p> 
<p>Sandi Metz starts off her wonderful book Practical Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby stating that the world is procedural. Your day is procedural; beginning with waking up, you typically do things in a certain order (for instance, you definitely get dressed before you to work). She also states Object-Oriented software views the world as object-oriented. You interact with objects all day long that come with their own behaviors and characteristics. Sometimes the behaviors are predictable and sometimes they aren’t. Life is a series of spontaneous interactions between objects but object-oriented programming teaches you to thinking of everything as messages that pass through objects instead of an assortment of predefined procedures. The way she describes it, Object-oriented programming just sounds a lot more organized and at the same time less controlled.</p>
<p>A Mister John Barker argues that the primary reason for OOP is because of inheritance but even that isn’t useful because it forces you to structure your code in advance “with all of it’s connections and intricacies.”</p> 
<p>John Hughs in his Why Functional Programming Matters articles states the advantages of functional programming as more or less the fact that it contains no assignment statements (so when you give a variable a value, it doesn’t change), easier to debug and are generally no side effects, and no flow of control. He also mentions that functional programming is a tad shorter and so takes less memory.</p>
<p>The former chair of the international conference on functional programming states the downsides have to do with isolation and barriers to entry. </p>
<p>A Mister John Cook breaks it down to this: Object-oriented programming makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts where as Functional programming makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts. To me the no flow of control also sounds like it could be a downside.</p>
<p>In the end, both have similar abilities to break things down into smaller bits and that can be combined and recombined. Because they each have their uses  good software typically has both. James Hague argues that 100% functional purity is impractical and that one should aim for 85% purity.
