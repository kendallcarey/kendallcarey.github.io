# U2.W5: Die Class 1: Numeric


# I worked on this challenge Kendall Carey and Tim Howard.

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: the number of sides when you call the method
# Output: a random number between 1 and the number of sides that were input
# Steps: 

create a class, define the die method, define .sides and .roll


# 3. Initial Solution

class Die
  def initialize(sides)
    # code goes here
  end
  
  def sides
    # code goes here
  end
  
  def roll
    # code goes here
  end
end
