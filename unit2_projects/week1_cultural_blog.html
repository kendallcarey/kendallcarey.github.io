				<h2 id="deep">This emotional conflict blog is deep. You have been warned.</h2>
				<p> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>

<p>The last time I had emotional conflict with someone was a little over a year ago with my ex-husband. I found out that I had no idea who he was. From there, I learned that I wasn’t as emotionally invested in him as I thought I was.</p>

<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>

<p>I had just found out that he was a sociopathic pathological liar. Everything he told me about his life - his career, his education, his family, his past – was completely untrue. Even his name was fake. But it wasn’t like he just told a white lie, he told a million big lies and spent his free time trying to cover them up. I am a lawyer’s daughter.  I look for evidence and he provided (faked) evidence.</p>

<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>

<p>I was in shock for a while. I needed to step back, look at my life and see if it was worth salvaging. Eventually, I decided that my marriage was beyond hope but at least I could rescue myself. I tried breaking things off in person but he tried to kill himself. So I escaped. He went to work one day and I packed everything that was absolutely mine into my car (with my little dog) and drove from LA to SF to start over.</p>

<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>

<p>Things were bad for a while. He became suicidal and stalked me a few times a week (not sure how he found me). Luckily, he gave up after a month due to health reasons.</p>

<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>

<p>I wouldn’t have taken so much time to plan my exit (which took months). I should have walked out the door the moment I found out he was a fraud.</p>

<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>

<p>Always trust your instinct. In my gut, I knew something was off but I ignored it because I was wanted to believe him. If I had trusted him, I wouldn’t have looked for evidence like a lawyer’s daughter.</p>
