				<p id="center">I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">video</a> and I found it fascinating! It’s best to start the video around 7:30. It’s about identity and stereotype threat and how it affects people.  Everyone has social identities. As Claude Steel describes it as ‘the part of our personal identity – our sense of who we are- that comes from our group memberships and the social categories to which we belong: age, sex, race, religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, region, social class, ideological persuasion, political affiliation, mental health status, etc.’ What makes them important to us is if we have to deal with our social identity regularly to the point where we can feel it. I actually find it funny because I had mentioned this exact kind of thing in my first email to my fellow cohorts where we were supposed to state our fears of taking Dev Bootcamp. This is what I wrote that pertains to stereotype threat:</p>

<p id="center">“This is another giant fear of mine: ability to be taken seriously and getting a job afterwards. I want to be taken seriously as a graduate of DBC but also as female coder. I have many friends in tech who like to crack jokes on female coders (one of them went so far as stating that it is rare that women are as 'good' as men in computer science). It makes me nervous that my gender may just fill the minority role at some companies and not actually be acknowledged for good work which could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy and spiral downwards from there. I mean, why else are there so few women in programming careers?”</p>

<p id="center">I have definitely felt the stereotype threat. Its hard not to feel your gender social identity especially when the negative stereotypes are typically used in humor or as socially accepted insults. For instance, how often have you heard these phrases: “You run like a girl” or “Women are terrible drivers”. Just a couple of weeks ago, one of my managers told us that he needed to hire more men in the bar because women get too emotional. Emotional?!</p>

<p id="center">So far I feel relaxed and comfortable at Dev Bootcamp and I can’t wait to prove the coding stereotype false. Hold on a second, I’m getting a little emotional!</p>
